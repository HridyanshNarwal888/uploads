Catholic elementary school in Munich, Germany (1885-1888)
Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich, Germany (1888-1894)
Cantonal school in Aarau, Switzerland (1895-1896)

when noble prize,"The Nobel Prize Awarding Institution, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, decided to reserve the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, and therefore no Physics Prize was awarded that year. According to the statutes, a reserved prize can be awarded the year after, and Albert Einstein was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922."
Award Ceremony Attend,"The Nobel Prize was announced on 9 November 1922. Being too remote from Sweden, Albert Einstein could not attend the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm on 10 December the same year."
what noble prize,"Einstein was rewarded for his many contributions to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect."
why noble prize,"Einstein was rewarded for his many contributions to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect."
photoelectric effect,"The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from the surface of matter (usually metals) when light shines upon it. Einstein explained the effect by proposing that light consists of small particles, or quanta, called photons, which carry energy that is proportional to the frequency of light. The electrons in the matter that absorb the energy of the photon get ejected. These findings were published in 1905 in the paper “On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light”. Einstein’s observations that the photoelectric effect could only be explained if light behaves like a particle, not a wave, was instrumental in establishing the hypothesis that light can behave both like a wave and a particle."
practical application,"The photoelectric effect is very important for our daily life. It is the basis for photosynthesis, which is like a very effective solar cell where sunlight is absorbed by plants to make them grow. The effect also forms the basis for a variety of devices such as photodiodes, which are used in light detection within fibre optics, telecommunications networks, solar cells, imaging and many other applications."
When Nobel Lecture,"He gave his Nobel Lecture on 11 July 1923 in Gothenburg, Sweden."
other scientific ,"Albert Einstein is one of the most influential physicists in the 20th century. In 1905 Einstein published four landmark papers in physics – on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity and equivalence of matter and energy (E=mc2). The year 2005 was named the “World Year of Physics” in recognition of the 100th anniversary of Einstein’s publications. Einstein is also well known for his general relativity theory published 1915 that complements his special relativity theory of 1905."
What Die,"The aneurysm, an enlargement of the abdominal artery filled with blood, which had been diagnosed earlier, had burst. He bled to death internally."
Why Die,"The aneurysm, an enlargement of the abdominal artery filled with blood, which had been diagnosed earlier, had burst. He bled to death internally."
brain removed,"Yes! The pathologist, who did this without permission, was Dr. Thomas S. Harvey. The autopsy was carried out few hours after Einstein’s death. As the bereaved learned about it they gave their belated approval to take out and scientifically examine Einstein’s brain."
autospy,"Yes! The pathologist, who did this without permission, was Dr. Thomas S. Harvey. The autopsy was carried out few hours after Einstein’s death. As the bereaved learned about it they gave their belated approval to take out and scientifically examine Einstein’s brain."
buried,There is no grave. According to Einstein’s wish his body was burned on the same day and the ashes were scattered after a simple ceremony at an unknown place.
last will,"Yes! It was signed by him on March 18, 1950. His secretary Helen Dukas and Dr. Otto Nathan were inserted as administrators of his will. The heirs were among others his step daughter Margot and his two sons Hans Albert and Eduard. His whole written property was given to the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where it is still to be seen today, in the Albert Einstein Archives."
where childhood,"He spent his childhood in Ulm from his birth in March 1879 until June 1880 and in Munich from June 1880 until December 1894. As a 15-year-old he followed his family to Milan (Italy), where his family had settled in the meantime."
like to play child,"Maja, Albert Einstein’s sister, reports in „Albert Einstein - Beitrag für sein Lebensbild“ (Albert Einstein – Contribution for his biography), that her brother very much liked to play with ""puzzles, jigsaw works, building complex constructions with a construction kit"". He liked best building houses of cards, which he was able to build up to 14 stories high as a ten-year-old. He was less interested in wild and sportive games with other children. With increasing age he began to read very much and very concentrated."
quick temper child,"Young Albert had a quick temper, however, it vanished during his first school years. Albert’s sister Maja reports in Albert Einstein - Beitrag für sein Lebensbild (Albert Einstein – Contribution for his biography) the following: ""In such moments his face became all yellow, however, the tip of his nose became snow-white, and he was no longer under control. At such an opportunity he once grabbed a chair and threw it after his teacher, who was so terrified, that she ran away and never came back again. His little sister was once thrown a big skittles ball on the head and a third time a children’s pick served as a device for, hitting somebody on the head."""
schools,"Einstein received private lessons at home starting in 1884 and attended „Petersschule” (Peter’s School), a catholic public school in Munich, from October 1885 until 1888. „Luitpold-Gymnasium“ (Luitpold Grammar School), also in Munich, followed from October 1888 until 1894. However, he left this grammar school before time in December 1894 without taking his exams. To make up his graduation exam (Matur) he attended the business department of the Cantonal School in Aarau, Switzerland from October 1895 until October 1896. He studied at the Polytechnic (the later Swiss Technical Academy, ETH) in Zurich starting in October 1896."
good or bad,"Albert Einstein, whose school performance seemed already very promising in elementary school, became a good student. He was always amongst the better students in his class. He received especially good marks in maths and the natural sciences, some worse marks in the languages, in drawing and in sports."
5 in math,"Einstein’s performance in maths was always well up to excellent and in his school reports he received the marks good and very good. The rumour about the 5 in maths has proposedly developed from the fact that in Einstein’s school reports, for example from the Cantonal School Aarau, the mark 5 and even 6 can be found in maths. However, we have to consider that the criteria for school performance in Germany and Switzerland are different. That means, mark 1 (very good) in Germany corresponds to mark 6 in Switzerland; mark 2 (good) equals mark 5; etc."
repeat year school,Albert Einstein never had to “repeat a year” during his whole school time.
leaving certificate,"He passed the school leaving examination (Matur) at the Cantonal School in Aarau, Switzerland, in October 1896."
after school,"Einstein studied at the Polytechnic (the later Swiss Technical Academy, ETH) in Zurich from 1896 until 1900. The aim of his studies was the subject teacher diploma for maths and physics. He ended his studies successfully in July 1900."
military service,"No! Einstein escaped the German military service by giving up the German citizenship as 17-year-old with the approval of his father. It was different with Swiss army. Einstein became a Swiss citizen in February 1901 and was summoned by the military officials for the medical examination one month later. At the medical examination on March 13, 1901 Einstein was attested varicosities, flat and sweaty feet.
Thus he was declared ""Unqualified A"" (""Untauglich A"") by the examination committee. The “A” means, that he could only be used for ""helpers’ services"" (""Hülfsdienste und Platzdienst""). However, the Swiss Army has never summoned Einstein to perform these services."
married,"Yes! Albert Einstein was married two times. He married Mileva Maric (1875-1948) in January 1903, a former fellow student from his time as a student at the Polytechnic in Zurich. They were divorced in February 1919. 4 months later, in June 1919, he married his cousin Elsa Löwenthal (1876-1936), nee Einstein."
children,"With Mileva Maric, his first wife, he had three children.
Lieserl (1902-?), who was born illegitimate, Hans Albert (1904-1973) and Eduard (1910-1965)."
nickname children,"As a child Hans Albert was called Buio, Swiss for “boy”. However, in Einstein’s letters he was also only called Bu. Later Hans Albert was called Adn or just Albert. Eduard was only called Tede or Tedel by Mileva, Serbian word for ""child"". In Einstein’s letters he is also called Tete, Tetel and Teddy."
tall,"In his Swiss ""little log book"" (Dienstbüchlein) of 1901 a body height of 171,5 cm is stated. In his passport dated 1923 175 cm are stated."
eye color ,Einstein had brown eyes (Source: Einstein’s passport dated 1923).
left right handed,Einstein was right-handed.
hobby,Einstein very much liked to play the violin and the piano. Sailing was also special to him.
instrument,"	He played the violin and the piano."
on more violin,"He had several violins in his life. The ""last"" violin was handed down to his grandson, Bernhard Caesar. Legend has it that Einstein called all its violins Lina – supposedly deduced from ""violin""."
good violin player,"Here different opinions do exist. Ze'ev Rosenkranz writes in his book , Albert Einstein - Privat und ganz persönlich (Albert Einstein – Private and very personal) about Einstein playing the violin: ""... He himself liked to scoff at his 'incompetence', which he rarely found “impressing”, however, this did not reduce his joy in playing the 'violin'. Supposedly he was a good amateur musician with an own intuitive understanding of the music. In his later years he didn’t like the notes produced by himself any more; in the end he stopped playing the violin and only fantasized on the piano."""
favourite composers,"Next to Mozart, whose music he liked best, there were for example Vivaldi, Bach, Schubert and Corelli."
sailing boat,"Einstein had a boat in Caputh, near Potsdam, named Tümmler, which was confiscated during the national socialist seizure of power in 1933 and sold one year later. In the US he had a sailing boat of his own called Tinnef."
swim,Though Einstein liked sailing very much he could not swim. He even denied to use swim vests. This led to his family always worrying very much when he was out sailing.
smoke,He smoked cigar and pipe despite his wife Elsa and his doctors forbid him to smoke .
alcohol,"Albert Einstein drank only few alcohol. If at all, a glass of wine or a little glass of cognac. Mostly he only sipped on the alcoholics served to him."
favourite book and a favourite author,"Einstein liked reading very much and he read a lot. Therefore it is difficult to name single books or authors. Despite that fact a small selection in the following: He very much liked to read Don Quijote by Cervantes Saavedra and The Karamasow Brothers by Dostojewski. David Humes Traktat about human nature had according to Einstein’s own words quite an influence on his development.
Here the authors have to be mentioned Poincaré, Mach, Tolstoi, Heine, Shaw as well as Schopenhauer and Spinoza. As a student he read with increasing enthusiasm the Naturwissenschaftlichen Volksbücher (Natural-Scientific Popular Books) by Aaron Bernstein and dealt among other things with Ludwig Büchners Kraft und Stoff (Energy and Matter) and Kant’s Kritik der reinen Vernunft (Critique of Pure Reason)."
